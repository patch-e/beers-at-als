                <p>Made by <a href="http://mccrager.com" target="_blank">Patrick Crager</a>, lover of beer and fan of <a href="http://www.alsofhampden.com/" target="_blank">Al's of Hampden / Pizza Boy Brewing Co.</a> in Enola, PA. If you haven't had the pleasure of visiting Al's, make it a priority and be sure to use my app while you are there :)</p>

                <p>I made the app because Al's website wasn't mobile friendly at the time and I was constantly not wanting to leave my table to see the tap list which isn't easily readable from every seat in the building! In other words, pure physical laziness and an excuse to build something fun.</p>

                <p><b>Technical Crap</b><br>The front-end of this website is an AngularJS app utilizing Bootstrap and jQuery. The back-end, that provides live up-to-date data from Al's website, is an Express node.js app utilizing a MongoDB database all running on IIS 7.5. The code is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/patch-e/beers-at-als" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
